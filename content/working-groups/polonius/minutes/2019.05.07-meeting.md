In this shorter meeting, we spent most of the time on the previous week's work:
- [Niko] has written more [notes](https://github.com/rust-lang/polonius/issues/104#issuecomment-489681898) and [steps](https://github.com/rust-lang/polonius/issues/104#issuecomment-489691804) for implementing liveness. With these, most of liveness is described (modulo the specifics of `drop`) :tada:. 
- [Albin] smoothly continued work on computing liveness in Polonius in [#105](https://github.com/rust-lang/polonius/pull/105), and rustc's [#60266](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/60266): finishing up last week's steps about the beginning of fact generation, and preparing to emit the ones needed to compute the `region_live_at` relation.
- [Rémy] started looking at rustc's test suite behaviour under `--compare-mode polonius` in more detail. While initially the number of failures looked [big](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/compare/master...lqd:polonius_tests), [Matthew] mentioned their in-review PR [#60171](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/60171), which would contain most of the differences seen in these initial runs, as it unifies the NLL mode under which both of these test modes are ran.
- [@lokalmatador] successfully got rustc building and prepared for profiling.

Useful future tasks we mentioned:
- even though we always think about the topic, we noticed analyzing the test suite, tests and correctness, are tasks which should actually be mentioned in the Roadmap.
- the polonius compare-mode likely has little or no documentation, fixing that would be important as part of the general documentation effort needed by the project.

For the following week:
- [Albin] will continue on liveness.
- To get ahead of the liveness game, [Niko] will look at and describe more of the `drop` specifics.
- [Rémy] will continue on the rustc test suite results, especially on top of [#60171](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/60171). But also write the previous meetings' notes they forgot to do (but as you can attest, dear reader/reviewer, got done eventually).
- [@lokalmatador] will have a bit less time in the immediate future but will afterwards be able to start profiling and looking at the [benchmarking tasks from the Roadmap](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Polonius-Roadmap--AdGLuHfuHXoGGL0vCLwXgtysAg-hk3a9ynduUN2gk1A0NNTF#:uid=627651028890979090145392&h2=Benchmarking-suite).
