## What is the goal of this working group?
This working group aims to accomplish the following:

- Ensure that major components of rustc are covered in rustc-guide
- Ensure that API doc coverage is at least 90%

# How can I get involved?
If you are interested in getting involved in this working group, come and say hi in the Zulip
stream. You can be added to the Zulip group for the working group if you are interested in being
pinged when there are available tasks.

## Meetings
We follow a "sprint-like" structure where on each "sprint" cycle we start with a planning and then
work towards the goals defined on that plan.

- **Desired experience level:** Any
- **Relevant repositories:** [`rust-lang/rust`][rust-repo] and [rust-lang/rustc-guide][rustc-guide-repo]
- **Zulip stream:** [`#t-compiler/wg-learning`][zulip] on Zulip
