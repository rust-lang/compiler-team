# Working Groups
This directory contains the notes for each of the active working groups. Each folder contains a few
files, along with files specific to that working group:

- `README.md` -- describes the basic details of the working group and how to get involved
- `NOTES.md` -- updated regularly with the latest news
- `FAQ.md` -- a place to document the answer to frequently asked questions

An exhaustive list of working groups can be found [at the root of this repository](../).

## Guidelines
These guidelines exist to serve team members who are about to start a new working group.

### Mentoring Issues
Mentored issues are a great way for new contributors to get involved without needing to ask for
a good first issue and wait for a response. When creating mentored issues, open a topic in the
Zulip stream and link to it from the mentoring instructions for people to leave a message in if
they are interested.

### Compiler Team Check-in
Each week, a rotating set of working groups will check-in with the compiler team at the end of the
compiler team's weekly triage meeting. By default, the working group's leads will handle this
however a designated liaison can be sent instead - as long as whomever is running the meeting is
informed.
Consider scheduling any meetings before the compiler team check-in and encourage each contributor
to add status updates to a shared document. This can make it easier to write notes for this
repository and to check-in.

### Meetings
The working group itself is not required to hold meetings, however should the group feel it would
be helpful then they are free to. Any meetings should be added to the compiler team calendar so
that other interested parties can find out about the meeting. If meetings are not held, then it
would still be desirable to keep the `NOTES.md` in the working group's directory
up-to-date.

### Membership
Typically working groups don't have formal members outside of the specified leads. Those interested
in participating in a working group can instead subscribe to the working group in order to be added
to relevant groups for notification purposes.

#### Explanation
Membership would be useful for recognizing regular participants of a working group and providing a
team lead with a group of people distribute work amongst. However, as it is desirable to enable
anyone to easily add themself as a member of a working group they are interested in participating
in - so they can receive notifications and assigned tasks - this has the effect of limiting the
extent to which working group membership can be used to recognize regular participants. Therefore,
formal membership is typically not pursued.
