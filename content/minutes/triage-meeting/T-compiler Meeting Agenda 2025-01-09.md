## MCPs/FCPs

**Note**: there are a few [MCP in FCP status](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Acreated-asc) that technically can be closed as accepted. Due to the overlapping holidays in western timezones, we allowed a bit more time for people to look at them. We're going to close them soon :-)

- New MCPs (take a look, see if you like them!)
  - "Rename "dylib" crate type to "rdylib" (keep old name but deprecate it), and maybe do the same for "staticlib" â†’ "cstaticlib"" [compiler-team#825](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/825) ([Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/233931-xxx/topic/Rename.20.22dylib.22.20create.20type.20to.20.22rdylib.22.20.28k.E2.80.A6.20compiler-team.23825))

## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2025-01-07](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2025-01-07.md)

A quiet week with not much going on. A small regression was caused by a bugfix related to traits, but
it was somewhat offset by a cargo update that brought a small perf. win.

Triage done by **@kobzol**.
Revision range: [93722f7e..0f1e965f](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=93722f7ed56bcf27839a6355074095c4320b7d37&end=0f1e965fec3bc2f97b932e9dd8e85fca6d7faadc&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated)
- "Built-in attributes are treated differently vs prelude attributes, unstable built-in attributes can name-collide with stable macro, and built-in attributes can break back-compat" [rust#134963](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/134963)
  - nominated by @**Jieyou Xu** (also T-lang nominated)
  - Questions for T-compiler (in opening comment):
    - Built-in attributes like `#[coverage(..)]` are handled differently versus prelude attributes like `#[test]`, including name resolution.
    - Current feature-gating of unstable built-in attributes is insufficient: adding a new unstable built-in attribute gated behind a feature gate (e.g. `#[coverage]`) can still break stable code without any feature gates (e.g. use of a user-defined macro of the same name as the newly added built-in attribute).
    - (also for T-lang) Stabilization of a built-in attribute can break backwards compatibility: old code can be broken by addition of a new built-in attribute.
