## Performance logs

> [triage logs 2025-01-14](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2025-01-14.md)

A quiet week with little change to the actual compiler performance. The biggest compiler regression was quickly recognized and reverted.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [0f1e965f..1ab85fbd](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=0f1e965fec3bc2f97b932e9dd8e85fca6d7faadc&end=1ab85fbd7474e8ce84d5283548f21472860de3e2&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

#### Regressions

- Probably just noise, and if not, it's not really worth investigating.


mir_transform: implement `#[rustc_force_inline]` [#134082](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/134082) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=336209eef13882bd1e211b24779584cb7ef911eb&end=b1a7dfb91106018f47ed9dc9b27aee1977682868&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)                   | mean  | range          | count |

| All  (primary)                 | 0.2%  | [-0.1%, 0.3%]  | 11    |
- Looks like some regressions snuck back in since the last run - I'm unsure if something happened in a rebase to reintroduce them.
- The actual regressions are much smaller than the original perf run, and I don't think they're big enough to demand an investigation.

- From the PR "Small chaotic effect is expected, small binary size improvements oddly line up with the effect I was going for. Seems unlikely they're connected though, I wouldn't be surprised to see a different list of affected scenarios after merge."

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated)
- "Status of the riscv32im-risc0-zkvm-elf target" [rust#135376](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/135376)
  - Nominated by @**nora (Noratrieb)**
  - This target was added in #134721 basically does not have a standard library, or we can make make a stub of it to make it compile, only to let the developer discover that the code is just not working ([comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/135376#issuecomment-2585402732)).
  - The question is: do we want to allow this kind of target, without a real `std`? The alternative to this target would be using the existing `riscv32im-unknown-none-elf` with a RISC0-provided crate for the system calls.
  - Also `T-libs` nominated, since this question is probably in their purview

[RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated)
- No I-compiler-nominated RFCs this time.
