caused by this work. See also some

Fixing P-critical regression, so easily justified.

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated)
- "Add `-C hint-mostly-unused` to tell rustc that most of a crate will go unused" [rust#135656](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/135656)
  - Nominated by @**Jubilee** ([comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/135656#issuecomment-2599339130)), left some questions for T-compiler
  - [MCP#829](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/829), not yet seconded
  - The proposal should substantially decrease compile times in some cases by hinting rustc when part of a crate is unused. Can regress in other cases ([Zulip thread](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/131828-t-compiler/topic/Computing.20mono.20items.20rustc.20codegenned.20that.20went.20unused/near/494438606))
  - Maybe a design meeting, inviting also people having more context? cc @**lqd** @**Ben Kimock (Saethlin)**
