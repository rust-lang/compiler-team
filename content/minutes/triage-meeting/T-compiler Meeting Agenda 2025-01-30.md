# T-compiler Meeting Agenda 2025-01-30

## Announcements

- Today dot release 1.84.1 is out ([blog post](https://github.com/cuviper/blog.rust-lang.org/blob/rust-1.84.1/posts/2025-01-30-Rust-1.84.1.md))
- Compiler Team Planning meeting at <time:2025-01-31T16:00:00+01:00>
  - List of open [meeting proposals](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Ameeting-proposal)
  - If we could schedule this one [compiler-team#813](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/813) would unblock work by @_**jdonszelmann** and @_**Celina Val**
  - Work is happening at rust#128045 (originally started by Felix) which is [T-lang nominated](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/128045#issuecomment-2596890170) but this [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/128045#issuecomment-2597716359) from @**oli** indicates that ... it's not blocked on T-lang?
- Reminder: if you see a PR/issue that seems like there might be legal implications due to copyright/IP/etc, please let us know (or at least message @_**davidtwco** or @_**Wesley Wiser** so we can pass it along).

### Other WG meetings

- WG-async design meeting <time:2025-01-30T19:00:00+01:00>

## Performance logs

> [triage logs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2025-01-27.md)

Relatively quiet week, with one large-ish regression that will be reverted.
[#132666](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/132666) produced a nice perf. win, by skipping
unnecessary work. This PR actually reversed a regression caused by a [previous PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/131984).

Triage done by **@kobzol**.
Revision range: [9a1d156f..f7538506](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=9a1d156f38c51441ee51e5a068f1d0caf4bb0f27&end=f753850659bdf5788332525f3fe395685929c682&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

#### Regressions

- This regression was deemed [justified](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/134478#issuecomment-2558271305), it was caused by a bugfix.
- Marked as triaged.

Rollup of 7 pull requests [#135947](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/135947) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=22a220a1a8280a262a277fc24661511f6c4dab51&end=1c9837df1dde9b234229709e89b3672bd3cf04a4&stat=instructions:u)

| All  (primary)                 | 0.7% | [0.1%, 2.2%] | 15    |

- Small regression on doc builds.
- It's unclear which PR  caused the regression, as our automation for unrolling PRs has failed here
for some reason.
- I don't think that it's worth it to manually post PR reverts and perf. test them for this kind of
a doc regression.

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated)
- "Improve documentation when adding a new target" [rust#135992](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/135992)
  - T-compiler was asked to review the wording, specifically the part about the new target needing to also be supported by `cc-rs` and `libc` support (which needs rustc support *first*, creating a cyclic dependency)
  - Discussed also on the [Zulip thread](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/131828-t-compiler/topic/Improving.20docs.20for.20adding.20new.20targets)

[RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated)
- No I-compiler-nominated RFCs this time.
