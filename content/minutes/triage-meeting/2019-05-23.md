# 2019-05-23

## Volunteers wanted

- No issues discussed this week.

## Backport decisions

- "Fix ICE with inconsistent macro matchers" ([#61046](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/61046))
  - Backport accepted

- "debuginfo: Revert to old/more verbose behavior for -Cdebuginfo=1" ([#61007](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/61007))
  - Backport accepted

## Working group sync

### [wg-pgo](../../../working-groups/pgo/)

- PGO stands for Profiler Guided Optimization.

- Code is instrumented and then run. The profilng data gathered at runtime is then used in subsequent compilations to guide optimizations. 

- PGO support is almost complete!
  - The remaining work is mostly just around the UI side of things: documenting compiler flags, moving flags from `-Z` to `-C`.
