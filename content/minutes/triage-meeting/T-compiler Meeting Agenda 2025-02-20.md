## Performance logs

> [triage logs for 2025-02-18](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2025-02-18.md)

This week's results were dominated by the update to LLVM 20 ([#135763](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/135763)),
which brought a large number of performance improvements, as usual. There were also two other
significant improvements, caused by improving the representation of `const` values ([#136593](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/136593)) and doing less work when formatting in `rustdoc` ([#136828](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/136828)).

Triage done by **@kobzol**.

- Resolves a previous perf. regression from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/136180, and then some.

- A great win for doc benchmarks.

| All  (primary)           | 0.5%  | [0.5%, 0.5%]   | 1     |

- Tiny regressions in doc builds, probably caused by more documentation in portable-simd.
- Marked as triaged.

- Three tiny changes, the only regression is on an incr-unchanged run of a parser stress test,
  probably doesn't warrant further investigation.
- Marked as triaged.

Update to LLVM 20 [#135763](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/135763) [(Comparison Link)](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2162e9d4b18525e4eb542fed9985921276512d7c&end=ce36a966c79e109dabeef7a47fe68e5294c6d71e&stat=instructions:u)

| (instructions:u)         | mean  | range          | count |
|:------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions (primary)    | 5.1%  | [0.2%, 35.1%]  | 8     |
| Regressions (secondary)  | 0.7%  | [0.4%, 1.0%]   | 10    |
| Improvements (primary)   | -1.3% | [-4.2%, -0.2%] | 251   |

| All  (primary)           | -1.1% | [-4.2%, 35.1%] | 259   |

- As usual, update to a new lLVM version brings a lot of performance wins, but also some regressions.
- The single large regression was on a release (optimized) incremental build, which is not a
configuration used much in practice. It was caused by a codegen unit becoming unnecessarily large.
- Marked as triaged.

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated)
- "Our x86-32 target names are inconsistent" [rust#136495](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/136495)
  - @**RalfJ** replied ([comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/136495#issuecomment-2656914059)) to the questions we raised during last meeting:
    > [...] what to do with i586-pc-nto-qnx700? A target with a Pentium 4 baseline. We typically use i586 to indicate "older than i686" (with i686 meaning "Pentium 4"), so there is a direct conflict here between the vendor convention and our own convention, which will easily be confusing for Rust users.
- "process bug: stabilization of `extended_varargs_abi_support` without FCP?" [rust#136896](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/136896)
  - @**Jubilee** suggest discussing the evaluation/procedural error. Both T-lang (first) and T-compiler (later) approved #116161 ([timeline](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/136896#issuecomment-2653329646)) but we don't find an FCP (i.e. a wider consensus)
  - Specifically, was this just a slip or is there an actual procedural "bug" (see [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/136896#issuecomment-2654440700))?

[RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated)
- No I-compiler-nominated RFCs this time.
