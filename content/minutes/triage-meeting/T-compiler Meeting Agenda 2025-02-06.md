- It appears that #136180 is the culprit for this regression. I'm not sure it's worth addressing though.

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated)
- "Our x86-32 target names are inconsistent" [rust#136495](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/136495)
  - ([Zulip thread](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/131828-t-compiler/topic/x86-32.20target.20names/near/497467753)) @**RalfJ** would like the T-compiler attention on a number of x86 tier 3 compile target, which naming is inconsistent (or inaccurate)
  - This PR is to gather feedbacks and opinions
- "Pattern Migration 2024: try to suggest eliding redundant binding modifiers" [rust#136577](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/136577)
  - @**Nadrieril** mentioned he was oriented to ask for a backport ([Zulip discussion](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/131828-t-compiler/topic/Backporting.20disgnostic.20changes.3F/near/497933188))
  - Context: the edition migration lint for match ergonomics is subpar, see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/136047 and https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/136456. Given that it will likely affect many users and the details are nonobvious, it felt important (to me Nadri) to have that fix for the stable realease of the edition
  - it's not the smallest PR; a smaller PR could maybe be done but I (Nadri) don't have the bandwidth. the current PR is almost 100% infallible span/label manipulations so hopefully that's not too risky to merge
