## Working group sync

### [wg-rfc-2229](../../../working-groups/rfc-2229/)

- RFC 2229 is a proposal to change how closures capture variables.
Instead of capturing the complete variable when a part of it is used (ie `foo.bar`), only the "path" will be captured by the closure.

- This requires a large amount of refactoring in the compiler.

- There is currently a PR open which implements part of this but it regresses compiler error messages in some situtations.

- There's been ongoing discussion as to next steps and other refactorings some of which have issues with light mentoring steps available.

### [wg-self-profile](../../../working-groups/self-profile/)

- wg-self-profile has been making progress toward the "minimum viable product" tracking issue [#58967](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/58967):
  - A crate called measureme has been created which handles serializing and deserializing profiler events to a compact binary format.
  - The crate has been integrated with the existing self-profile infrastructure in rustc.
  - There are now summarization and flamegraph tools for processing the profiler data in the repo as well.

- The next step is to work on integrating the summarization tool with perf.rlo.
