  - Approved for stable backport.

## Working group sync

### [wg-rls-2.0]

- The Chalk dependency has been updated which dramatically reduced crashes.

- `cargo check` handling has been moved ino the server so all editors not just VS Code benefit.

- [@matklad] and [@nikomatsakis] have been working on an RFC to merge RLS and Rust Analyzer officially.

- Work is proceeding on "production readiness".
  - Binary releases are available on the project's GitHub page.
  - Planning to publish to VS Code extension marketplace "soon".

### [wg-self-profile]

- The ["Minimum Viable Product"][sp_mvp] has been completed!
  - Self-profling is enabled for all perf.rust-lang.org runs and we automatically publish the data. ([Example][sp_example])

- [@mw] implemented query-key recording so queries can now be attributed to individual query invocations.

- The [`crox`] utility, which generates Chromium profiler compatible trace data, can now generate profiles for entire Cargo invocations via the `--dir` flag.
  - This allows inspecting various rustc processes and their individual threads on a common timeline with full query data.

- Quite a few people have tried `-Zself-profile` and have said they found it very useful!
