  - T-release say they can handle but it's a lot of work ([comment](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/131828-t-compiler/topic/Backporting.20disgnostic.20changes.3F/near/497933188)) and @_**Jubilee** pointed that if something behaves funny we should be there to fix quick
  - (unsure if a lot changed - in positive or negative - since last week)

## Performance logs

> [triage logs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2025-02-10.md)

A relatively neutral week, with lots of real changes but most small in
magnitude. Most significant change is rustdoc's move of JS/CSS minification to
build time which cut doc generation times on most benchmarks fairly
significantly.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [01e4f19c..c03c38d5](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=01e4f19cc8027925ffe0885a86388b700e46bfab&end=c03c38d5c2368cd2aa0e056dba060b94fc747f4e&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

Changes are expected, from a few contained PRs:
- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/136073#issuecomment-2617093212
- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/136435#issuecomment-2629382897

Generally expected to only meaningfully affect stress tests rather than
real-world code.

Regressions are mostly in LLVM, seemingly due to more logic being added to
common code (e.g., pass enumeration) that runs even on non-AMDGPU targets. This
is also a significant size regression (+19MB on LLVM.so) but generally these
are likely unavoidable in the short term at least given the expanded target
set.

Unclear as to exact cause, but not going to dig in further given small number
of benchmarks affected (only primary is `libc`, and it improved).

## Nominated Issues

[T-compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3AI-compiler-nominated)
- "Update to rand 0.9.0" [rust#136395](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/136395)
  - Mark raises some concerns about this upgrade, specifically about the new dependency `wit-bindgen-rt` which ships with a small binary blob ([comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/136395#issuecomment-2645783005))
  - @_**Alex Crichton** says that making it buildable (and not only "reproducible") is possible though it would make maintenaince more complicated on their end ([comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/136395#issuecomment-2645877220)). What they're lacking is support for weak symbols on stable Rust, specifically `cabi_realloc`, defined in multiple crates across a single link unit
  - What do we think about it? Do we want to establish a policy? ([comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/136395#issuecomment-2645783005))
- "Revert "Stabilize `extended_varargs_abi_support`"" [rust#136897](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/136897)
  - we stabilized this set of varargs. The `extern "system"` part is however broken, as per updated [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/100189#issue-1330688823):
    > extern "system", on systems where it is meaningful (i.e. distinct from extern "C" in some way), is translated to extern "stdcall" which is incompatible in varargs
  - @**Jubilee** suggests reverting everything quickly before the release (artifacts start building tomorrow), then reapply everything expect the `system` part ([comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/136897#issuecomment-2652458348))
  - [Zulip topic](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/131828-t-compiler/topic/extended_varargs_abi/near/499126726)
- "process bug: stabilization of `extended_varargs_abi_support` without FCP?" [rust#136896](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/136896)
  - @**Jubilee** suggest discussing the evaluation/procedural error. Both T-lang (first) and T-compiler (later) approved #116161 ([timeline](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/136896#issuecomment-2653329646)) but we don't find an FCP (i.e. a wider consensus)
