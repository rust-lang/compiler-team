## Volunteers wanted

- request for investigation: "Compiler panic with generic-typed nested closures" ([#59494](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/59494))

- request for investigation: "Exponential compile-time and type_length_limit blowup when nesting closure wrappers" ([#54540](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54540)) 
  - eddyb has excellent notes [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54540#issuecomment-485240110) on the fundamental problem
  
- request for investigation: "llvm lint: "Undefined behavior: Call argument type mismatches callee parameter type" with mixing debug and release" ([#48310](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48310))
  - specifically, we need to resolve whether this is in fact an LLVM bug
  
- request for investigation: "ICE with unsized associated type" ([#60431](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/60431))
