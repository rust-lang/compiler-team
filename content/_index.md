# compiler-team

A home for compiler team planning documents, meeting minutes, and
other such things. If you're interested in learning about how
**rustc** works -- as well as advice on building the compiler, preparing a PR,
and other similar topics -- check out the [rustc-guide].

## Quick facts

- **Where to find us:** We are primarily present on [Zulip](about/chat-platform.md), though some of us also monitor Discord.
- **Want to attend a meeting or follow along?** See the "meeting calendar" section below.
- **Looking for technical information about how the compiler works?**
  Check out the [rustc-guide](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rustc-guide/).

## Meeting Calendar

Our meeting calendar is publicly available from the following links:

  - [Web Link][embed]
    -- use this to view the calendar or to import into Google Calendar
  - [ICS file, for use outside from google calendar][ics]
    -- use this if you want to import into different calendar software

Unless otherwise noted, all our meetings are open to the public and
held on Zulip. There are two main team-wide meetings that we hold on a
regular basis. There are also a variety of working group meetings.

### Triage meeting

We have a [weekly triage meeting][triage] to discuss and track regressions and
urgent changes. This meeting is held on Zulip and open to anyone.

### Steering meeting

We also have a [regular steering meeting][steering] where we discuss
proposed designs, changes to our process, and other topics. The topics
are scheduled at a planning meeting that occurs every four weeks.

- **Have an idea?** Click here to propose a topic to be scheduled by [filing an issue][propose] with the correct template.
- **Next planning meeting:** June 7
- **Scheduled meetings:**
  - May 17: [Shipping parallel rustc](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/82)
  - ~~May 31: [Maintenance and triage](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/90)~~ -- postponed

## Working Groups

Much of the ongoing work and initiatives from the compiler team are performed by working groups.
Working groups are a great way for new contributors to get involved as they provide a stream of
tasks all focused around one area and have designated channels for help and advice. All of the
active working groups are listed below:

## Expert Map

If you're interested in figuring out who can answer questions about a
particular part of the compiler, or you'd just like to know who works on what,
check out our [experts directory](experts). It contains a listing of the
various parts of the compiler and a list of people who are experts on each one.

## Procedures

The [procedures directory](procedures) contains descriptions of various
rustc procedures.
