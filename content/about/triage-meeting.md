# Triage Meeting
The compiler **triage meeting** is the place for tracking regressions, progress on urgent bugs and
checking-in with the compiler team's working groups. Each meeting, two working groups (rotating)
check-in with their progress and blockers.

The meeting takes place every week. See the [compiler team calendar](../../#meeting-calendar)
for the next scheduled meeting (normally weekly).

The triage meeting takes place on [Zulip](../chat-platform/). Look for a topic like
"#54818 weekly meeting YYYY-MM-DD" or "weekly meeting YYYY-MM-DD" (with the proper date, of course).
The regular agenda (and process for pre-triage) is maintained on [Rust Issue 54818].
