# Steering Meeting

The compiler **steering meeting** is the place for high-level
discussion and planning. The meeting takes place weekly. The topics of
the meeting are selected at periodic planning meetings. See the
[steering meeting procedure][proc] for more details. See [#58850] for
more information. 

[proc]: /procedures/steering-meeting.md

See the [compiler team calendar](../README.md#meeting-calendar) for
the topics of the next scheduled meetings. There is also a [dedicated
internals thread][internals].

The steering meeting takes place on [Zulip](chat-platform.md). Look
for a topic like "steering meeting YYYY-MM-DD" (with today's date, of
course).

There are [minutes from previous steering
meetings](../minutes/steering-meeting) available in this
repository. These minutes summarize our conversations.
