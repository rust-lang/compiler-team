The compiler team hangs out primarily in [the rust-lang Zulip][z]
these days. The `#t-compiler/help` stream is a great place to ask
questions. In addition, each working group has 1 or more streams where
they communicate.

You can also find us on [the rust-lang Discord][d], in the `#compiler`
channel.

The `#rustc` IRC channel on `irc.mozilla.org` is in a
"quasi-deprecated" status and is not recommended.
