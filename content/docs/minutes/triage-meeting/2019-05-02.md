## Volunteers wanted

- call for assistance: Does someone have an ARM (and maybe also MUSL?) host they could use to try to replicate ["Stable rustc always panics on arm/musl"](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/60297)

## Backport decisions

- There were no beta- nor stable-nominations for backport.

## Working group sync

### [wg-meta](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/blob/master/working-groups/meta/README.md)

- The compiler contributor RFC is in FCP and should be merged soon.

- They are trying to get some sort of "design meeting" up and going.
The plan is to discuss that initial proposal in more depth tomorrow at steering meeting, and then get started after that.

- The compiler-team repo has a list of issues tracking things that wg-meta would like to get done.
  - call for assistance: [Convert the compiler-team repo to use GitHub pages](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/73)

### [wg-rls-2.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/blob/master/working-groups/rls-2.0/README.md)

- Lots of progress happening!

- Work is being done to expand macros by example so the analyser can understand the generated code.

- Chalk is being integrated ([#1216](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/1216)).

- The rustc lexer code is being extracted into a separate crate ([#60261](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/60261)).
