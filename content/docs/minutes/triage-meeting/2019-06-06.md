## Working group sync

### [wg-mir-opt](https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/blob/master/working-groups/mir-opt/README.md)

- const propagation (by Wesley Wiser) on mir opt level 2
  - some great compile-time speedups due to llvm and later MIR passes having less to do
  - [Perf](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=7cdaffd7962c4aae0cadd82baa241901b03f9458&end=78f9292a51479346f19ce2c71bdb0db551ce8fe5) (active PR) has some regressions (up to 4% though)

- rewrite loads of recursive Place algorithms imperatively (by Santiago Pastorino)

- WIP PR by Santiago Pastorino for making Place a struct instead of an enum (preliminary work for making projections a slice instead of a recursive enum)
