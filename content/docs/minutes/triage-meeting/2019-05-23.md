## Working group sync

### [wg-pgo](../../../working-groups/pgo/)

- PGO stands for Profiler Guided Optimization.

- Code is instrumented and then run. The profilng data gathered at runtime is then used in subsequent compilations to guide optimizations. 

- PGO support is almost complete!
  - The remaining work is mostly just around the UI side of things: documenting compiler flags, moving flags from `-Z` to `-C`.
