## Volunteers wanted

- No issues discussed this week.

## Backport decisions

- There were no beta backport nominations this week.

- "Use informational target machine for metadata" ([#58605](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls/58605)) was nominated for backport to stable.
  - [Nomination was declined](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/weekly.20meeting.202019-04-18.20.2354818/near/163655391)

## Working group sync

### [wg-llvm](../../../working-groups//llvm)

- `wg-llvm` is working on optimizing `overflow` intrinsics with `add` and `sub` instructions.

- A PR ([#59546](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/59546)) has also been opened to fix [a long standing unsoundness issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28728).
The PR is currently waiting for someone to run lolbench.rs to determine what impact the PR has on generated code performance.

### [wg-async-await](../../../working-groups/async-await/)

- `wg-async-await` is currently working though the list of [issues blocking stabilization](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/AsyncAwait-Blocking).
  - This includes:
    - [Async-await syntax](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/60016)
    - [Supporting async fns whose arguments have multiple lifetimes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/56238)
    - [Shrinking the size of generators](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/52924)

- The thorniest issue remaining is determining the drop order for unused async function arguments ([#54716](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54716))
  - While investigating this issue, some subtle inconsistencies regarding existing drop order for regular functions were discovered.
  - This issue is also not proving to be easy to resolve.
