## Working group sync

### [wg-llvm](../../../working-groups/llvm/)

### [wg-async-foundations](../../../working-groups/async-await/)

- The [list of blocking issues](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AAsyncAwait-Blocking) is shrinking!

- Two major issues have had signficant work done on them:
  - nikomatsakis posted a PR which closes a number of lifetime related issues.
  - tmandry is working on shrinking the size of futures.
 
- Work is commencing on the "async book" which will help explain how async I/O works and the async-await feature in particular.

- Many more tests need to be written around the feature.
  - This might be a good way to get involved with the working group!
