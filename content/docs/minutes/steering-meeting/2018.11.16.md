# 2018.11.16

The topic of today's steering meeting was [future
planning](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147822055). Specifically,
we were looking at some of the ideas we've had for major initiatives
and trying to drill into them and make them more concrete. You can
read the [full thread over on
Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16).

We began by [observing that the ultimate decisions we make here will be very influenced by the number of leaders we can find, and what they want to do](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147822224), and ultimately decided to [focus first on the technical angle](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147822373) before thinking about what leaders we have etc.

We [made an initial breakdown of the work to be done into some big areas](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147822529), which was [later amended](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147823187) with a [few more](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147823299) areas:

- parallelize with many threads
- improving "batch compilation":
  - do what we do now, but better:
    - type-check faster, trait checking, etc
    - optimize MIR and generate better LLVM
    - do things better in the backend / improve ThinLTO ([link](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147823284))
    - avoid things like dsymutil
    - need to look at "time breakdown" across projects a bit perhaps?
  - defer, coallesce, and avoid work
    - multi-crate compilation model
    - MIR-only rlibs, which helps identify duplicates as well as dead code
    - "polymorphization" to coallesce monomorphized instances that have the same code
  - distribute and cache work across machines
- improving RLS experience:
  - end-to-end queries
  - incrementalization
  - ...
- "UX" improvements
  - continue compiling even when errors occur, particularly getting through to the borrow check phase ([link](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147823465))
  - error-message work
  - ...
  
For the rest of this conversation, though, we [focused on batch compilation](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147823187). We discussed opportunities for getting estimates of the effectiveness of some of these ideas:

- for [MIR-only rlibs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38913), mw [already did some of that work](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38913#issuecomment-369584928). There is great potential, but we need effective parallelization.
- thanks to hard work by Zoxc, mw, and others, we have a prototype parallel implementation, so [mw volunteered to gather some data](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147825002)
- for [polymorphization](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147823725), we can of course use LLVM's mergefunc to get some idea, but it [seems likely that we can find more opportunities than LLVM does](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147824096), and of course we would also [operate earlier](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147823876) so the impact is larger. We would  begin by doing an analysis over MIR -- **this would be a great place for someone who wants to work on a more weighty project to get involved**.
  - one concern is that [debuginfo and polymorphization may be tricky to combine](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147824173)
- in principle we should be able to see, for large projects, [how much code we wind up using in the end from dependencies](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147824478), which might give us wins if we can defer that work through multi-crate compilation

One question mark that was raised was how important it is to extend the query system further into the front-end of the compiler -- that code is [currently usually pretty fast relative to compilation as a whole](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147824592). However, if we want to really transform the RLS experience, [we clearly need great progress here](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147824733). So to some extent this **may** come down to the [relative importance of RLS vs batch compilation](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147824754). Ultimately, the consensus was that we need to [**measure and get a clear idea where we are spending our time**](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147824772) (shocker).

A lot of these topics we've discussed above will require major architectural overhauls to the compiler, so one thing we discussed was the [desire to sketch out those refactorings and the dependencies between them](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147824592) into a kind of chart. We also talked about the need to "pay down" technical debt through cleanup refactorings, and how [those refactorings should be given high priority](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147825118). Finally, we talked some about how the [rustc crate graph](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-11-16/near/147825213) could stand for some reorganization -- this perhaps falls under technical debt. =)

(Fun fact: we [initially split rustc into crates](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/19002) not for compilation time but rather because -- shortly before 1.0 -- the memory usage for compiling and linking the rustc crate was exceeding 4GB, preventing us from issuing builds on 32 bit machines.)

### Action items

We enumerated some goals to try and get done before the next steering meeting. If you'd like to help with one of these tasks, let nikomatsakis know!

- take another stab at collecting and organizing ideas, incorporating ideas around UX in particular, but also breaking out RLS from batch compilation (nikomatsakis)
- gather statistics about where we spend our time from perf and perhaps elsewhere (?)
- draw up a proposal for polymorphization analysis / strategy (maybe nikomatsakis?)
- collecting some numbers on how parallel queries performs these days (mw)
- draw the graph of refactor dependencies (eddyb/nikomatsakis, perhaps?)
