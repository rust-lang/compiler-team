## What is the goal of this working group?
This working group aims to accomplish the following:

- Improve the `-Z self-profile` option in `rustc` which dumps various events into a file.
- Implement additional tools to explore, visualize and understand the data contained in the output file.

## What is the current status?
The working group is working on creating a "minimum viable product" of the self-profiling feature. 
Progress is tracked in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/58967.
