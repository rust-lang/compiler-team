This document contains meeting notes from the NLL working group.

## 2019-02-22: [Triage Meeting][triage20190222]
**Written by:** [@davidtwco][davidtwco]

**Purpose of meeting**: Given slow winding down of the NLL working group, discussed the ongoing
purpose of the meeting. [@spastorino](spastorino) suggested using the time as an space for open
discussion and office hours (as previously suggested by [@pnkfelix][pnkfelix]).
[@pnkfelix](pnkfelix) would continue to perform weekly triage before the meeting and will leave the
triaged issues unassigned so that interested parties can assign themselves.

**Place 2.0**: Discussion turned to the ongoing Place 2.0 work being undertaken by
[@spastorino][spastorino]. Clarifications and discussion of the feasibility of current
implementation plan took place. Work will continue as planned.
