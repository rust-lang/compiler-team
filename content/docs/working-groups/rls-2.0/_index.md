# Scope and purpose

Discover ideal architecture for IDE-compiler by starting a "from scratch" implementation. Especially, how to handle the two hardest things:

* name resolution/macro expansion
* trait resolution

Quantify how hard would be to port existing rustc to the IDE architecture.

## Secondary Goals

* provide better RLS experience by making a "better racer"
* facilitate rustc librarification by discovering and prototyping separable libraries
* facilitate specification of the language, by producing "more declarative" implementation

## Deliverables

* a language server which provides compiler-based code completion for a subset of the Rust language.
* "design knowledge": which approaches do and do not work in IDE contexts.
* (optional) improvements to existing tooling, like replacing racer in RLS with something more powerful, or making rustfmt capable of dealing with incomplete code.

# Current status

An initial language-server is implemented in the [rust-analyzer].

## Meetings

We don't have a regular meeting schedule yet, check [Zulip][s] to learn about
the next one. However, we maintain [work list] -- a paper document that shows
what everyone is working on right now. If you want to (this is not mandatory),
add yourself to the list!

## rust-analyzer

Currently the bulk of work is happening in the [rust-analyzer] repository.
It has [E-mentor] issues and a [guide].

[guide]: https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/master/docs/dev/guide.md


## Getting up to speed

There's some documentation in rust-analyzer repository which should be useful.
There's a YouTube [playlist] with videos which cover various subsystems of the
analyzer.
