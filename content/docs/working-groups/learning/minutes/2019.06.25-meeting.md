# Learning WG 2019-06-25 sync meeting

## Helping with mdbook

- igaray says that doc team has taken up this work and it is not very specific to WG-learning

## Blog post announcing documentation efforts and tasks, ...

- It wasn't clear to us where such a post would be published
    - spastorino will check with niko and see if this can be posted on rust blog or if we need some other dev-blog.rlo
    - igaray volunteers to write a quick post if we can post on blog.rlo

## Tracking lectures desire, recorded, transcribed

- spastorino will experiment with some of the existing lectures:
    - one github project
    - one issue per lecture, with the project tracking its status
    - rustbot claim to claim a lecture
- If this works, we can move away from large checklist tracking issues.

## What to add from forge.rlo bibliography

- Doesn't look like any of the papers are particular to any part of compiler, but they are interesting/useful

- mark-i-m will add as an appendix to rustc-guide

- related discussion:
    - lokalmatador will link to lecture videos from their walkthrough chapter
    - we will also add links to the tops of the transcribed chapters
