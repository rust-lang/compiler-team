## Meetings
We follow a "sprint-like" structure where on each "sprint" cycle we start with a planning and then
work towards the goals defined on that plan.

- **Desired experience level:** Any
- **Relevant repositories:** [`rust-lang/rust`][rust-repo] and [rust-lang/rustc-guide][rustc-guide-repo]
- **Zulip stream:** [`#t-compiler/wg-learning`][zulip] on Zulip
