## What is the goal of this working group?
This working group aims to accomplish the following:

- Finish, optimize, and test the implementation of parallel compilation to an extent
  that allows making it the default.
- Produce solid documentation of how parallel evaluation works, how it is
  implementated, and what things it might affect in the [rustc-guide][rustc-guide].

## What if I don't have much time?
If you don't have time to contribute code but you do compile your own compiler,
the consider setting `parallel-compiler = true` in your `config.toml`. If you
find a bug, we'd love it if you could file an issue.

## Are there any resources so I can get up to speed?
There are some resources available for those interested in contributing to get some background
and context:

- Zoxc's [introductory post][zoxc-internals-post] in the _internals_ forum.
- More to come...
