## What is the goal of this working group?
This working group aims to accomplish the following:

- Implement and stabilize profile-guided optimization in `rustc` (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/59913)

## Are there any resources so I can get up to speed?
There are some resources available for those interested in contributing to get some background
and context:

- Tracking issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/59913
- Clang's [documentation on PGO](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#profile-guided-optimization).
  Contains lots of useful information on PGO in LLVM.
- @emilio's [initial PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/48346) for adding experimental
  support for PGO.
- A presentation on [Profile-based Indirect Call Promotion in LLVM](https://llvm.org/devmtg/2015-10/slides/Baev-IndirectCallPromotion.pdf), an optimization enabled by PGO

## Do I need to attend any meetings?
No.
