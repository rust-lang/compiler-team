This week, we worked on — and discussed — the following topics:

#### 1. Proposal: stop tracking subset relations along the CFG

[Niko] wrote up an issue with more details about the proposal: [issue #107](https://github.com/rust-lang/polonius/issues/107). We also discussed it more in the dedicated zulip thread, around [this point](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/186049-t-compiler.2Fwg-polonius/topic/subset.20relations.20and.20polonius/near/167407904).

We made an example where the new refinement would improve on Polonius' behaviour: it currently flags an unnecessary error on [this example](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=52fbcbf0fdf3c55542476842053994a6).

[Niko] later [realized](https://github.com/rust-lang/polonius/issues/107#issuecomment-499427026) that the refinement as proposed could also be less precise than current Polonius (which accepts the example in the comment), and which could require making the `equality`-tracking flow-sensitive.

Some more exploratory work is planned around these refinements, and also around their interaction with other topics: for example "illegal subset relation errors" would likely need an approach similar to the "placeholder loans" we discussed [around here](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/122657-t-compiler.2Fwg-nll/topic/polonius/near/152599003), and prior to that, [here](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/122657-t-compiler.2Fwg-nll/topic/polonius.20subset.20considered.20unnecessary/near/148870693).

To prepare for the call on this topic, [Rémy] tried implementing a quick [prototype and examples](https://github.com/rust-lang/polonius/compare/master...lqd:variant_prototype). As of this writing, it seems to work on the simpler example datasets from the Polonius repository, but not on the more realisic use-case (`clap`) so more bugfixing will be needed. [Rémy] also wrote a [short report](https://hackmd.io/EqECXcd7TIGj97lVNc4dhw?view) about those quick explorations.


#### 2. Call about `subset` relations, the proposal, Oxide

We had a [recorded video call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAUGvNgZYtw) about the specifics of the `subset` relation, its role and why it was propagated along the CFG. We then talked in more detail about the proposal refinement(s), and finished with a comparison between the Polonius model and the Oxide model.

To follow along the video: the paper document we used to record notes and examples can be [found here](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Polonius-and-subset-propagation--AemU19yUmQ461DupzxgaCj2NAg-2uMIPkQSbqpPjqrJ9L9DM).

Huge thanks to everyone involved, it was super interesting and fun !


#### 3. Profiling and performance

[@lokalmatador] has been successfully gathering early results :tada: (for example, [this profiling data](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/user_uploads/4715/C7fHB1wgXXWWxNrd1N8sbRy1/measurements.zip) comes from some of examples in the Polonius repository). The next steps will then be to collect some data from the official rustc benchmarking suite.


#### 4. Rustc test failures under Polonius

[Rémy] has (slowly) continued work on analyzing the `ui` test suite failures under Polonius. Now that [Matthew]'s [PR #60171](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/60171) has landed: the WIP branch was rebased into a more stable state. 

New failures were unfortunately found, but most of the simpler differences were "taken care of". The analysis will need to be double-checked, and the WIP report is [here](https://hackmd.io/CjYB0fs4Q9CweyeTdKWyEg?view). 

There are still a couple of simple cases left (differences in diagnostics only, for example) before looking at the remaining more complicated cases, but those seem to be actual "regressions" somewhere (probably divergences between the Polonius facts, NLL constraints, and assumptions about MIR).


#### 5. Liveness

:tada: [polonius#105](https://github.com/rust-lang/polonius/pull/105) has landed :tada:

Now, to get the [rustc changes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/60266/) landed, we were still wondering about the differences between the `region_live_at` facts computed by rustc, and the ones computed by Polonius. The liveness computation in rustc is taking initialization into account, while rustc PR #60266 only slightly (which is expected as move/initialization analysis is the next item [Albin] plans to tackle). 

[Niko] and [Albin] discussed ([around here](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/186049-t-compiler.2Fwg-polonius/topic/liveness.20polonius.23104/near/167883671)) a way to remove the computation of the `region_live_at` relation without losing precision, as both a safety measure and an intermediary step towards handling moves/initialization.

With [Niko] being away at Mozilla All Hands next week, we mentioned that we might do short async updates instead of a sync meeting, but the plan was overall:

- [@lokalmatador] will continue gathering profiling data.
- [Albin] will look at the potential `region_live_at` intermediary step we mentioned.
- [Rémy] will continue on the rustc test suite analysis, and the proposal prototype.
