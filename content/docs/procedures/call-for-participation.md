# Call for participation

One way to get help with a project is to issue a **call for
participation** on the dedicated internals thread.

Such calls should follow this (very simple) template, so as to help
clarify what's going on:

```
- **Title:** Investigate #123141
- **Experience level expected:** (Newcomer | Contributor | Experienced)
- **Urgency:** (ASAP | over next few months | whenever)
- **Contact:** @your-name-here in [the #your-stream-here stream on Zulip][z]

[z]: https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/

Longer description goes here.
```

You should feel free to substitute other text for Experience Level
Expected and Urgency, but the idea is to convey our expectations to
people. In particular, the Urgency field is supposed to indicate how
*quickly* people would need to work on this.
