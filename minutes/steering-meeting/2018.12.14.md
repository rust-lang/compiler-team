# 2018.12.14

The steering meeting was focused on **mentoring**. Some of the prompting questions:

- How can we help move people from "working group participant" to "full-fledged team member"?
- How can we reduce the ["bus factor"][] for cricial modules like the type checker, type resolver, etc?

A summary of the major points raised follows. If you prefer, you can

## Major points: Mentoring

- it seems good to try and [list out the parts of the compiler and who
  is an expert in each
  one](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151781649),
  perhaps in some kind of ["introduction to the compiler team" page on the repository](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151781864)
  - this can help identify [where to direct your questions about code X](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151781864)
  - but also where we need to increase the number of knowledgable people
- it would be great if we had an [organized off-ramp system](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151782070)
  for folks who have been active in a working group and are looking to broaden their knowledge
  - maybe we can [pair up such folks with someone
more
experienced](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151782619)
  - this is a [different sort of mentoring](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151782971), since active people from a
    WG are already familiar with how the compiler works, and thus able to work at a higher level
  - we need to find a way to make it easier to [find "intermediate-level mentoring opportunities"](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151782469).
- we might try to actively increase bus factor via [fixing issues](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151781737), writing tests, or writing docs
  - writing tests can be driven via [code coverage measurements](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151782245)
  - writing docs can be driven via
    [`deny(missing_docs)`](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151781803)
    as well as [push to complete the missing rustc-guide
    sections](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151781969)
  - one problem with writing documentation is that [there always seems
    to be something that is higher
    priority](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151781986),
    maybe implying we need it as a roadmap item
- a [dedicated `#t-compiler/help`
  stream](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151782693)
  would be a good way to call attention and request mentoring
  - [maybe other streams as needed](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151782111)
  - also, [documentation on how to use zulip seems like a win](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151782350)

## Major points: process for refactorings, documentation

Towards the end, we also discussed the **procedure we should use for
larger compiler refactorings** as well as how to ensure the compiler
is documented.

- [before landing a massive refactoring or new architecture](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151784501):
  - ideally, [talk out the design on an internals thread to achieve some light consensus](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151784204)
  - expect documentation [in the form of rustc-guide chapters](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151783865)
- some examples where we should do this:
  - [end-to-end queries](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151783972)
  - [parallel query execution](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151784316)
- in terms of the rustc-guide:
  - it'd be [great to improve mdbook to permit for graphs](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151783887)
    - maybe we can [add graphviz support into mdbook](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151784431)
  - we should [not neglect doc comments](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151784445)
    - and we can link [back](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151784542) and [forth](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151784551) [copiously](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151784688) (and [make sure we check for dead links](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/subject/steering.20meeting.202018-12-14/near/151784647))
