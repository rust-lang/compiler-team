probably don&rsquo;t need to get formal about members vs contributors, the
key point is that if somebody is confident that (a) they know this
is the right approach and (b) they know others will agree, they
should feel free to move a major change forward (and leave notes to
that effect on the issue)</li></ul></article></div><aside class="book-toc level-6 fixed"><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#summary>Summary</a></li><li><a href=#motivations>Motivations</a></li><li><a href=#initially-proposed-process>Initially proposed process</a></li><li><a href=#what-is-a-major-change>What is a &ldquo;major change&rdquo;?</a></li><li><a href=#why-this-will-help>Why this will help</a></li><li><a href=#notes-from-the-meeting>Notes from the meeting</a></li><li><a href=#final-proposed-process>Final proposed process</a></li><li><a href=#a-few-more-last-minute-notes>A few more last minute notes</a></li></ul></nav></aside></main></body></html>
