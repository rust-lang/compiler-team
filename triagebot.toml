This is a tracking issue for MCP "${mcp_title}" (rust-lang/compiler-team#${mcp_number}).

> [!NOTE]
> Tracking issues are used to record the overall progress of implementation.
> They are also used as hubs connecting to other relevant issues, e.g., bugs or open design questions.
>
> A tracking issue is however *not* meant for large scale discussion, questions, or bug reports.
> Instead, open a dedicated issue for the specific matter, link to this tracking issue and ping the MCP author.
> Alternatively, post in the Zulip stream linked from the MCP.
>
> Discussion comments will get marked as off-topic or deleted.
> Repeated discussions on the tracking issue may lead to the tracking issue getting locked.

### Steps

- [ ] Implement the MCP
- [ ] Adjust documentation
  - [ ] In the [Rust Compiler Development Guide] if applicable (e.g., for refactorings)
  - [ ] In the [Rust Forge] if applicable (e.g., for policy changes)
  - [ ] In the [rustc book] if applicable (e.g., for target tier or CLI changes)
