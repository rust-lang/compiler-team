# Proposal

*Insert your proposal here, overwriting this text and the text under "Mentors or Reviewers", leaving the rest of the template untouched. Please include the complete proposal, rather than linking to a gist or other external document.*

*Your proposal doesn't have to be long. It should however be in sufficient detail that people familiar with the code can clearly envision what you are planning to do. Be sure to link to any relevant issues, PRs, or other sources.*

*When picking a title (that is, when replacing the "(My major change proposal)" text above), keep in mind that Zulip truncates text that extends beyond a certain length, replacing the truncated suffix with "â€¦" in the topic name it creates. Therefore, consider keeping your title to <= 40 characters, if possible.*

# Mentors or Reviewers

*If you have a reviewer or mentor in mind for this work, mention them here. You can put your own name here if you are planning to mentor the work.*

# Process

The main points of the [Major Change Process][MCP] are as follows:

* [x] File an issue describing the proposal.
* [ ] A compiler team member who is knowledgeable in the area can **second** by writing `@rustbot second` or kickoff a team FCP with `@rfcbot fcp $RESOLUTION`.
    * Refer to [Proposals, Approvals and Stabilization](https://forge.rust-lang.org/compiler/proposals-and-stabilization.html) docs for when a second is sufficient, or when a full team FCP is required.
* [ ] Once an MCP is seconded, the **Final Comment Period** begins.
    * Final Comment Period lasts for 10 days after all outstanding concerns are solved.
    * Outstanding concerns will block the Final Comment Period from finishing. Once all concerns are resolved, the 10 day countdown is restarted.
    * If no concerns are raised after 10 days since the resolution of the last outstanding concern, the MCP is considered **approved**.
