Does github Projects works nice for this? Plan for walkthrough/overview chapter Goal is to have a chapter which will walk through compilation of simple program Links to other chapters for details This overview differs from the existing queries chapter in that the latter is more focused on how to create your own queries.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://unbalancedparentheses.github.io/compiler-team/docs/working-groups/learning/minutes/2019.05.28-meeting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://unbalancedparentheses.github.io/compiler-team/docs/working-groups/learning/minutes/2019.05.28-meeting/</guid><description>Learning WG 5.28.19 sync meeting Triaging rustc-guide repo Some discussion about how to assign issues on the rust-lang/rustc-guide repo Problem: can&amp;rsquo;t assign issues to non-members Possible solutions: Add WG-learning members to repo so they can be assigned use triagebot model: bot is assigned the issue and edits the OP to mention the current owner.
