Such calls should follow this (very simple) template, so as to help clarify what&amp;rsquo;s going on:

These guidelines were originally discussed at the Rust All Hands 2019 by the compiler team and others; and then at the 01/03/2019 steering meeting.
Out-of-tree crates One of the primary goals of this policy is to ensure that there is consistency in how out-of-tree crates used in the compiler are set up (at least, those maintained by the compiler team and living in rust-lang) and that the experience is uniform across rust-lang/rust and these crates.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://unbalancedparentheses.github.io/compiler-team/docs/procedures/form-new-working-group/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://unbalancedparentheses.github.io/compiler-team/docs/procedures/form-new-working-group/</guid><description>Forming a new working group So, you would like to form a working group?
Step 0. What is a working group? Working groups are the basic way that the compiler team tracks what is going on. If you are doing some sort of task that the compiler team will want to track over time, then it makes sense to form a working group, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t plan to be getting a more people involved.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://unbalancedparentheses.github.io/compiler-team/docs/procedures/steering-meeting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://unbalancedparentheses.github.io/compiler-team/docs/procedures/steering-meeting/</guid><description>Steering meeting The &amp;ldquo;steering meeting&amp;rdquo; is a weekly meeting dedicated to planning and high-level discussion. The meeting operates on a repeating schedule:
Week 1: Planning Week 2: Technical or non-technical discussion Week 3: Technical or non-technical discussion Week 4: Non-technical discussion The first meeting of the 4-week cycle is used for planning. The primary purpose of this meeting is to select the topics for the next three meetings.</description></item></channel></rss>
