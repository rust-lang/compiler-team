# Triage Meeting
The compiler **triage meeting** is the place for tracking regressions, progress on urgent bugs and
checking-in with the compiler team's working groups. Each meeting, two working groups (rotating)
check-in with their progress and blockers.

The meeting takes place every week. See the [compiler team calendar](../README.md#meeting-calendar)
for the next scheduled meeting (normally weekly).

The triage meeting takes place on [Zulip](chat-platform.md). Look for a topic like
"#54818 weekly meeting YYYY-MM-DD" or "weekly meeting YYYY-MM-DD" (with the proper date, of course).

## Working group check-in
