# Triage Meeting
The compiler **triage meeting** is the place for tracking regressions, progress on urgent bugs and
checking-in with the compiler team's working groups. Each meeting, two working groups (rotating)
check-in with their progress and blockers.

The meeting takes place every week. See the [compiler team calendar](../README.md#meeting-calendar)
for the next scheduled meeting (normally weekly).

The triage meeting takes place on [Zulip](chat-platform.md). Look for a topic like
"#54818 weekly meeting YYYY-MM-DD" or "weekly meeting YYYY-MM-DD" (with the proper date, of course).

## Working group check-in
This section contains the scheduled check-ins for working groups:

- **2019-03-14:** [wg-rls-2.0], [wg-meta]
- **2019-03-21:** [wg-self-profile], [wg-rfc-2229]
- **2019-03-28:** [wg-self-profile], [wg-rfc-2229]

Looking for a meeting that isn't listed above? Make a PR and extend the list to include that
meeting, just loop around the list of working groups.
