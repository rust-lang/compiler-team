# Steering Meeting
The compiler **steering meeting** is the place for high-level discussion and planning. The meeting
takes place every three weeks -- so twice per release. There is a [thread on internals][internals]
where we discuss what we will be talking about and also scheduling decisions. See [#58850] for
more information. See the [compiler team calendar](../README.md#meeting-calendar) for the next
scheduled meeting.

[#58850]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/58850
[internals]: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/compiler-steering-meeting/8588

The steering meeting takes place on [Zulip](chat-platform.md). Look for a topic like
"steering meeting YYYY-MM-DD" (with today's date, of course).

There are [minutes from previous steering meetings](../minutes/steering-meeting) available in this
repository. These minutes summarize our conversations.
