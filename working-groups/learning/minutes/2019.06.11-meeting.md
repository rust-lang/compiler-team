# Learning WG 2019-06-11 sync meeting

## WIP stuff

- Write an overview chapter (lokalmatador)
    - Steady progress, about to finish up the part on HIR and moving on to MIR
    - Changed the example to bubblesort in the meantime using some mutable borrows
    - Stick to old trait solver for now, according to Niko
    - Draft/WIP: https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/A-first-glance-at-rustc--AexZRkGI1D_0C_eqE5ZBqmgjAQ-Mk45wFbBKBT9C8e9rPaCd

- Transcribe the Compiler Lecture Series into chapters
    - amanjeev: debugging support
        - Merge what we have and iterate
        - Needs to be reviewed
    - juanbono: coherence in chalk
        - Working with igaray
    - igaray: representing types in rustc
        -  No progress, but have not dropped it

- Add rustc guide to toolstate (mark-i-m)
    - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/59772
    - libssl dependency is annoying (need to investigate)

- Closure desugaring work (mark-i-m)
    - https://github.com/blitzerr/rustc-guide/pull/1
    - waiting on author who seems busy... will probably just merge and iterate later

- Organizing MIR and HAIR talks (spastorino)
    - oli-obk is going to do something this month, needs time

## Triaging rustc-guide

- spastorino will ask @Pietro Albini about progress on triagebot.
- If triagebot will be ready soon, wait.
- Otherwise add people to the repo with read perms only. When triagebot is ready maybe switch to that.

## forge/guide, where to link

- There is a planned contributing page: https://github.com/rust-lang/www.rust-lang.org/issues/440
- If someone has time we (WG-learning) should try to push that forward, otherwise, waiting for this to be done...

## adding people rustc-guide toolstate

- spastorino volunteers to be added
