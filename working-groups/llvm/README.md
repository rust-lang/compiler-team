## Are there any resources so I can get up to speed?

To be written. LLVM development documentation should be linked prominently here.

## Do I need to attend any meetings?

Currently the working group is incubating, pending more time available from the people spearheading
the effort, and no meetings are being held in the meantime.

## How to find things to do?

[A-LLVM][a-llvm] label in the `rust-lang/rust` repository categorises the issues which have
something to do with how LLVM works. For the time being this is the best place to start.
