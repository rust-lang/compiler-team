## Plan for parallel-rustc

1. Gather the performance data of the feature internally
2. Make a "go/no-go" decision based on the data

## Gathered data

The most important data on our plan are recorded on [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/KmHulVmISKu7L2HmNgbPgg?both).

Experiments on other work-load are also welcome. The data are reported in the following topics on `Zulip#t-compiler/wg-parallel-rustc`:
