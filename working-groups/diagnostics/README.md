# Diagnostics Working Group
![working group status: active][status]

This working group aims to make rustc better at telling the user
why the compiler isnâ€™t smart enough to understand their code yet.

- **Leads:** [@oli-obk][oli-obk] [@estebank][estebank]
- **Meeting Notes:** [All](NOTES.md)
- **Meeting Driver Plan:** [On Hackmd](https://hackmd.io/T9yQwLQ0SIOguR1auo3SHQ)

## What is the goal of this working group?
This working group aims to accomplish the following:

- Make diagnostics emitting independent of the happy code path
- Separate the diagnostics rendering from the compiler so it can be reused by others.
