Does github Projects works nice for this? Plan for walkthrough/overview chapter Goal is to have a chapter which will walk through compilation of simple program Links to other chapters for details This overview differs from the existing queries chapter in that the latter is more focused on how to create your own queries.</description></item><item><title>Rustc Dev Guide WG 2019-05-28 sync meeting</title><link>https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/rustc-dev-guide/minutes/2019.05.28-meeting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/rustc-dev-guide/minutes/2019.05.28-meeting/</guid><description>Rustc Dev Guide WG 2019-05-28 sync meeting Triaging rustc-dev-guide repo Some discussion about how to assign issues on the rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide repo Problem: can&amp;rsquo;t assign issues to non-members Possible solutions: Add WG-rustc-dev-guide members to repo so they can be assigned use triagebot model: bot is assigned the issue and edits the OP to mention the current owner. Forge Discussed purpose of the forge and how it differs from rustc-dev-guide Niko feels that most of the content in the forge doesn&amp;rsquo;t obviously belong in the guide and that the stuff currently in the guide feels like it belongs in the guide Forge is for team procedures, infra stuff would also be good to add craterbot and rustc-timer links to forge (probably link to READMEs of their repos) link forge from main page my rule of thumb [for what to put in the guide] is sort of &amp;ldquo;is this something you would do while fixing a compiler bug or implementing a compiler feature&amp;rdquo; -niko</description></item><item><title>Rustc Dev Guide WG 2019-06-11 sync meeting</title><link>https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/rustc-dev-guide/minutes/2019.06.11-meeting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/rustc-dev-guide/minutes/2019.06.11-meeting/</guid><description>Rustc Dev Guide WG 2019-06-11 sync meeting WIP stuff Write an overview chapter (lokalmatador)

it&amp;rsquo;s hard because the preparation may put off potential lecturers maybe instead go for more informal zulip-based &amp;ldquo;explain everything you know about X&amp;rdquo; can then summarize zulip log agreed to change terminology from &amp;ldquo;transcribe&amp;rdquo; -&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;summarize&amp;rdquo;

@mark-i-m reported that toolslate/linkcheck is now working properly with following overview on how:
The linkchecker in the rust CI is run from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/rustbook. It just runs mdbook_linkcheck as a library. That is called by only one linux builder from the script in src/ci/docker/. The hack on the rustc-dev-guide CI checks the output of mdbook_linkcheck from stdout/stderr and looks for timeout errors.</description></item><item><title>Rustc Dev Guide WG 2019-08-21 sync meeting</title><link>https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/rustc-dev-guide/minutes/2019.08.20-meeting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/rustc-dev-guide/minutes/2019.08.20-meeting/</guid><description>Rustc Dev Guide WG 2019-08-21 sync meeting It was a fairly quiet meeting.

Everyone is taking notes in this paper doc. Discussion was about this lecture https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/issues/375 @Santiago Pastorino reported that How to build and run guide page needs help
Team might create a new doc for this page to collect ideas. @mark-i-m reported that

A consensus was reached which was noted on the master doc. Prioritizing the Overview lecture and doc over others. Working as a team on the lecture/doc. Team discussed to work with Hackmd vs Paper For this Overview doc. So we have experience with Paper as well as Hackmd.
